# Everything Everywhere All At Once â€“ Mini Puzzle Hunt

Quick and casual game I wrote for a Halloween party where I dressed up as a hibachi chef with a raccoon hidden in my hat. Do not expect puzzle hunt quality puzzles.

## Dev
```shell
npm run dev

## Note

The answers are returned to the client in plain text, which is obviously bad. It's just easier for me to find the answer while demoing.
